### JP Morgan’s Financial Solutions Lab

## What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?
The Financial Solutions Lab, co-founded by JP Morgan Chase, is a program that “seeks to identify, test and bring to scale promising [fintech] innovations that can help to improve financial health in America”, most notably to “underserved workers and diverse work environments”.

One of their initiatives was the so-called Financial Solutions Lab Challenge, in which start-ups competed to receive a $125,000
investment, partnership opportunities, and access to industry experts (which is probably the most important thing). The 2019 and apparently last round of Challenge winners was announced in January, but the FinLab itself may be more permanent, especially given its attractive “optics”.
